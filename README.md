# StudentGradeRecordSystem

This is a Windows Form application. I used Microsoft SQL Server as a database management system.
Teachers can view student information, update information, and see certain calculations automatically. And it keeps all data in its database. At the same time, students can view their own information by logging in with their student numbers.
